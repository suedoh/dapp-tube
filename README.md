## About

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use this DApp for educational purposes only! DTube is not responsible for the harm caused by the content you're uploading.

DTube uploads the video files to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) by using [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) and stores those IPFS [CID](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/)s to the blockchain network. Read the step-by-step tutorial üìù "[Build a Social Media dApp & Deploy it on Polygon](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/build-a-social-media-dapp-and-deploy-it-on-polygon)" to learn how to BUIDL it from scratch. If you have any queries, then please create a [discussion thread](https://github.com/akhileshthite/dtube/discussions).

## Development instructions

### Installation & setup

Make sure you have truffle installed on your computer.

```sh
# Install Truffle globally
npm install -g truffle
```

- Ensure you create an `.env` file in `root` directory. Then to access the Ethereum network/node, create a project on [infura](https://infura.io/) and copy-paste the `infura project-id url` in `.env` with a variable name `REACT_APP_INFURA_RINKEBY` or `any network you like`.

```sh
REACT_APP_INFURA_RINKEBY=https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

- Paste the 12 word Secret Recovery Phrase of your (preferably newly generated and testnet-only) MetaMask wallet in `.env` with the variable name `REACT_APP_MNEMONIC`. This will be loaded by truffle at runtime, and the environment variable can then be accessed with `process.env.REACT_APP_MNEMONIC`.

```sh
REACT_APP_MNEMONIC=for example put your twelve word BIP39 secret recovery phrase here
```

- For development and testing, you have to create your own web3.storage API token. To do that, `login to` [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) -> `create a new API token` -> `copy the API token`.

Then create a `.env` file in the root directory.

```bash
REACT_APP_API_TOKEN=PASTE_YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

OR

To develop on ganache blockchain, open ganache and import the accounts by adding your ganache private keys in MetaMask.

```sh
$ ganache-cli
```

### Deployment

To deploy the smart contracts on blockchain networks, follow the given truffle command below.

```sh
# truffle migrate --network NETWORK_NAME
truffle migrate --network rinkeby

# --reset: Run all migrations from the beginning, instead of running from the last completed migration.

```

For more information, read [truffle docs](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/).

### React client

Start react app.

```sh
npm start
Starting the development server...
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If dealing with ‚ÄúJavaScript heap out of memory‚Äù error after `npm start` then use the following command to solve it: `export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"`

> üìå Note: I cannot update this repo (main-branch) with react hooks because the initial [educational tutorial](https://learn.figment.io/tutorials/build-a-social-media-dapp-and-deploy-it-on-polygon) was written with react classes. However, if you want to work on this issue, then please `fork` the main branch and push your changes to `react-hooks` branch and send a [pull request](https://github.com/akhileshthite/dtube/pulls) for the same.

### Docker instructions
From the root directory where the `Dockerfile` can be found, run the following command:
```
docker build . -t dapp-tube
```
Once the image is built, use the following command to run the container:
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -d dapp-tube
```
To print the output of your app:
```
# Get container ID
$ docker ps

# Print app output
$ docker logs <container id>

# Example
Running on http://localhost:8080
```
If you need to go inside the container you can use the exec command:
## Enter the container
`$ docker exec -it dapp-tube /bin/bash`

## Shutdown the image
```
# Kill our running container
$ docker kill dapp-tube
```
